# This script uses simulations to replicate a dataset from a previous
# SUPERSMART run. Replication includes making a synthetic tree 
# resembling the final tree from the analysis, an appropriate taxa
# file and simulated sequence alignment files.
 
# Note that running this script will take considerable time and resources,
# so it is best to run it on a cluster computer.

# Note that this script must be called from the working directory of a 
# previous (completed!) SUPERSMART run.

# A directory name to store all simulated data and analysis results can be provided
# as an argument, if not given it defaults to 'simulations/' within the 
# current workind directory

# parse command-line arguments for simulation directory name
if [ -z "$1" ]
	then
	SIMDIR='simulations'
else
	SIMDIR=$1

# make directory to store all files for simulation analysis
mkdir $SIMDIR

# copy files from previous SUPERSMART run necessary to replicate tree and data
cp final.nex $SIMDIR
cp aligned.txt $SIMDIR
cp fossils.tsv $SIMDIR

cd $SIMDIR

# Replicate the dataset (final tree, taxa table and alignments)
smrt-utils replicate -t final.nex -f nexus -a aligned.txt -l replicate.log -v

# insert simulated sequences and possible artificial taxa into the database
# prefix for sequence accessions is the simulation directory
