are cleaned up afterwards.

=item version

Returns the version number of the ExaBayes executable.

=cut

sub version {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $exe;
    return undef unless $exe = $self->executable;
    my $string = `$exe -v 2>&1`;

    return version->parse($1) || undef;
}

=item new

This constructor takes the following mandatory arguments: 

    -f alnFile       a alignment file (either binary and created by parser or plain-text phylip)
    -s seed          a master seed for the MCMC
    -n ruid          a run id
    -r id            restart from checkpoint. Just specify the id of the previous run (-n) here. 
                       Make sure, that all files created by the previous run are in the working directory.
                       This option is not mandatory for the start-up, seed (via -s) will be ignored.
    -q modelfile     a RAxML-style model file (see manual) for multi-partition alignments. Not needed 
                       with binary files.
    -t treeFile      a file containing starting trees (in Newick format) for chains. If the file provides less
                       starting trees than chains to be initialized, parsimony/random trees will be used for
                       remaining chains. If a tree contains branch lengths, these branch lengths will be used
                       as initial values.
    -m model         indicates the type of data for a single partition non-binary alignment file
                       (valid values: DNA or PROT)

Optional arguments are:

    -d               execute a dry-run. Procesess the input, but does not execute any sampling.
    -c confFile      a file configuring your ExaBayes run. For a template see the examples/ folder
    -w dir           specify a working directory for output files
    -R num           the number of runs (i.e., independent chains) to be executed in parallel
    -C num           number of chains (i.e., coupled chains) to be executed in parallel
    -Q               per-partition data distribution (use this only with many partitions, check manual
                       for detailed explanation)
    -S               try to save memory using the SEV-technique for gap columns on large gappy alignments
                       Please refer to  http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/470
                       On very gappy alignments this option yields considerable runtime improvements. 
    -M mode          specifies the memory versus runtime trade-off (see manual for detailed discussion).
                       <mode> is a value between 0 (fastest, highest memory consumption) and 3 (slowest,
                       least memory consumption)
